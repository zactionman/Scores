Scores
By Zach Leinweber


The point of this is to guess the outcome of a football game based on a few known stats.
It first takes a few stats as inputs and then uses those to calculate the outcomes.

There are two versions of this program.  The GUI and the CLI.
The GUI version uses tkinter to draw a window and widgets.
The CLI version just runs in the command line.

Both versions rely on Scores_Base.py to run.
Run the CLI version by executing Score_CLI.py
Run the GUI version by executing Score_Gui.py

The math behind the program was supplied by Butch.
